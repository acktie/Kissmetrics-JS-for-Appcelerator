This is a sample project to show you how to use the KissMetrics javascript library and a simple
metrics delegator.  

The meat of the project is under Resources/metrics/kissmetrics.js

A sample of using the lib is in the applications.

Tests are included in and show additional ways to use the library.  NOTE: I know there are a bunch
of JS testing framework but just wanted something simple.  If you make changes to the lib you should
be able to run the test to ensure nothing broke.
